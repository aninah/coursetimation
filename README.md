# coursetimation
given courses, tell how far you are from finishing a major

done: 
- setup structure
- about page
- home page

next on the agenda:
- analyze course list and figure out what half the fields mean lmao
- throw course list into a database for easier querying

###features for me to think about
- option to pick how many semesters you have at brown? some sort of ability to pick that you have "two springs, two falls" left
- button to do only ABs/only SCBs
- button that says "I already have one major, it's : "
- crit review link for class recs

mvp: given a list of courses, returns how close you are to finishing a CS concentration. This is because I specialize in CS advising, but also because the CS concentration is one of the more complex concentration formats I've ever seen.
