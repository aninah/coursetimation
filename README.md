# coursetimation
given courses, tell how far you are from finishing a major

#### done: 
- setup structure
- start about page
- start home page
- analyze course list, figure out what I'm working with here
- throw course list into a database for easier querying
- create tentative calculations object framework

#### next on the agenda:
- create Computer Science object
- test how_many_satisfy method
- create easy way of generating requirements lists
	- may involve querying db. for example maybe take in requirement that is cs220+, and use db query to get all cs classes at 220 and above


#### features for me to think about
- option to pick how many semesters you have at brown? some sort of ability to pick that you have "two springs, two falls" left
- button to do only ABs/only SCBs
- button that says "I already have one major, it's : "
- crit review link for class recs 

#### mvp:
given a list of courses, returns how close you are to finishing a CS concentration. This is because I specialize in CS advising, but also because the CS concentration is one of the more complex concentration formats I've ever seen.
