		<h1> About This Project </h1>

		<p> Hello! My name is Anina Hitt, and I'm a senior at Brown. I do a lot of peer advising, and one thing that comes up for me all the time is when people have that mid-academic crisis, where they have decided they hate their major, but also don't have a lot of time to pick up a completely different major. The reason I'm even starting this project is because I helped two people with this issue this week. Each time took me about an hour to explore all the options with my advisee, given the courses they had already taken. I wanted to see if there was a better way to efficiently see what majors you could feasibly complete in your remaining time at Brown, given the classes you've already taken. 

		<h3>features for me to think about:</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>option to pick how many semesters you have at brown? some sort of ability to pick that you have "two springs, two falls" left</li>
		<li>button to do only ABs/only SCBs</li>
		<li>button that says "I already have one major, it's : "</li>

		<p>mvp: given a list of courses, returns how close you are to finishing a CS concentration. This is because I specialize in CS advising, but also because the CS concentration is one of the more complex concentration formats I've ever seen. </p>
